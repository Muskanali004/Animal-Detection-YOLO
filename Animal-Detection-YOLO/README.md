# YOLOv8-Based Animal Detection System

This project implements an animal detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. 
The model identifies animals in images and video footage using COCO animal classes such as:
`cat`, `dog`, `horse`, `cow`, `elephant`, `giraffe`, and more.

## Features
- Image animal detection
- Video-based detection
- Bounding box annotations
- Confidence score display
- Uses YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Google Colab friendly

## How to Run
### 1. Install Dependencies

### 2. Run script

### 3. For Colab
Simply upload the notebook and run all cells.

## Model Used
- **YOLOv8n.pt** from Ultralytics (pretrained on COCO)

## Output
The system draws bounding boxes and labels on detected animals in images or video frames.
